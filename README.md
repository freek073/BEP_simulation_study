# Simulation study EFA vs PFA
### Bachelor end project  

## Project description: 
In this project i'll do a simulation study where I'll compare exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and penelized factor analyis (PFA).
I'll look at different factor complexity, sample sizes and different penalties.

## Structure
The structure of the simulation study and the code in this github is as follows:
In the folder 'scripts' I'll be working in 4 different r scriptsm namely:

- data.r -> here I'll be generating the data for basic and complex factor loading
- EFA.r -> I'll analyse EFA in this script
- PFA.r -> I'll analyse PFA in this script
- plots.r -> I'll plot the outcomes of the simulations in this script

The structure has been made in this format so that it is organized and will allow for reproducibility
